#!/usr/bin/awk -f

#
# This program generates collapsed off-cpu stacks fit for use by flamegraph.pl
# from scheduler data collected via perf_events.
#
# Outputs the cumulative time off cpu in us for each distinct stack observed.
#
# Some awk variables further control behavior:
#
#   record_tid          If truthy, causes all stack traces to include the
#                       command and LWP id.
#
#   record_wake_stack   If truthy, stacks include the frames from the wakeup
#                       event in addition to the sleep event.
#                       See http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html#Wakeup
#
#   recurse             If truthy, attempt to recursively identify and
#                       visualize the full wakeup stack chain.
#                       See http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html#ChainGraph
#
#                       Note that this is only an approximation, as only the
#                       last sleep event is recorded (e.g. if a thread slept
#                       multiple times before waking another thread, only the
#                       last sleep event is used). Implies record_wake_stack=1
#
# To set any of these variables from the command line, run via:
#
#    stackcollapse-perf-sched.awk -v recurse=1
#
# == Important warning ==
#
# WARNING: tracing all scheduler events is very high overhead in perf. Even
# more alarmingly, there appear to be bugs in perf that prevent it from reliably
# getting consistent traces (even with large trace buffers), causing it to
# produce empty perf.data files with error messages of the form:
#
#   0x952790 [0x736d]: failed to process type: 3410
#
# This failure is not deterministic, so re-executing perf record will
# eventually succeed.
#
# == Usage ==
#
# First, record data via perf_events:
#
# sudo perf record -g -e 'sched:sched_switch' \
#       -e 'sched:sched_stat_sleep' -e 'sched:sched_stat_blocked' \
#       -p <pid> -o perf.data  -- sleep 1
#
# Then post process with this script:
#
# sudo perf script -f time,comm,pid,tid,event,ip,sym,dso,trace -i perf.data | \
#       stackcollapse-perf-sched.awk -v recurse=1 | \
#       flamegraph.pl --color=io --countname=us >out.svg
