Hot Cold Graphs
===============
These show both on-CPU time (in shades of red) and off-CPU time (blocked time;
in shades of blue) in a similar style to the Flame Graph.

======================
These are per-Thread Hot Cold Graphs, which helps separate logical functions
that are managed by their threads, and helps you estimate speed up for the
threads of interest.
