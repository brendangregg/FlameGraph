#
# thcstackcollapse.pl	collapse thread hot/cold multiline stacks into
#			single lines.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL: This is a work in progress, and may not work properly.
#
# Parses a multiline stack followed by thread ID, PID, TID, name, oncpu status,
# and ms on a separate line (see example below) and outputs a comma separated
# stack followed by a space and the numbers. If memory addresses (+0xd) are
# present, they are stripped, and resulting identical stacks are colased with
# their counts summed.
#
# USAGE: ./thcstackcollapse.pl infile > outfile
#
# Example input:
#
# mysqld`_Z10do_commandP3THD+0xd4
# mysqld`handle_one_connection+0x1a6
# libc.so.1`_thrp_setup+0x8d
# libc.so.1`_lwp_start
# thread:0x78372480 pid:826 tid:3 name:mysqld oncpu:1 ms:2664
#
# Example output:
#
# libc.so.1`_lwp_start,libc.so.1`_thrp_setup,mysqld`handle_one_connection,mysqld`_Z10do_commandP3THD 0x78372480 826 3 mysqld 1 2664
#
# Input may contain many stacks, and can be generated using DTrace.  The
# first few lines of input are skipped (see $headerlines).
