#
# hcstackcollapse.pl	collapse hot/cold multiline stacks into single lines.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL: This is a work in progress, and may not work properly.
#
# Parses a multiline stack followed by oncpu status and ms on a separate line
# (see example below) and outputs a comma separated stack followed by a space
# and the number. If memory addresses (+0xd) are present, they are stripped,
# and resulting identical stacks are colased with their counts summed.
#
# USAGE: ./hcstackcollapse.pl infile > outfile
#
# Example input:
#
# mysqld`_Z10do_commandP3THD+0xd4
# mysqld`handle_one_connection+0x1a6
# libc.so.1`_thrp_setup+0x8d
# libc.so.1`_lwp_start
# oncpu:1 ms:2664
#
# Example output:
#
# libc.so.1`_lwp_start,libc.so.1`_thrp_setup,mysqld`handle_one_connection,mysqld`_Z10do_commandP3THD oncpu:1 ms:2664
#
# Input may contain many stacks, and can be generated using DTrace.  The
# first few lines of input are skipped (see $headerlines).
