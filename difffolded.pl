#
# difffolded.pl 	diff two folded stack files. Use this for generating
#			flame graph differentials.
#
# USAGE: ./difffolded.pl [-hns] folded1 folded2 | ./flamegraph.pl > diff2.svg
#
# Options are described in the usage message (-h).
#
# The flamegraph will be colored based on higher samples (red) and smaller
# samples (blue). The frame widths will be based on the 2nd folded file.
# This might be confusing if stack frames disappear entirely; it will make
# the most sense to ALSO create a differential based on the 1st file widths,
# while switching the hues; eg:
#
#  ./difffolded.pl folded2 folded1 | ./flamegraph.pl --negate > diff1.svg
#
# Here's what they mean when comparing a before and after profile:
#
# diff1.svg: widths show the before profile, colored by what WILL happen
# diff2.svg: widths show the after profile, colored by what DID happen
#
# INPUT: See stackcollapse* programs.
#
# OUTPUT: The full list of stacks, with two columns, one from each file.
# If a stack wasn't present in a file, the column value is zero.
#
# folded_stack_trace count_from_folded1 count_from_folded2
#
# eg:
#
# funca;funcb;funcc 31 33
